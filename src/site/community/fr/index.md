      2020 after identifying several privacy risks we, as dating app users, are
      confronted with when looking for a date online: unwanted ads, harms
      resulting from incorrect profiling and predictions, the possibility of
      phishing and identity theft."

      ["Dating Privacy” Collective
      Launch](https://www.meetup.com/tech4goodLIN/events/276275535/)\

      During this short session, the collective presented the risks you take when using dating apps, shared practices to protect your privacy and explained how you can recover your data if you want to know what happens when you're swiping and liking. We also outlined our first major data literacy project: one [we want you to be involved in](/fr/act/sar).
