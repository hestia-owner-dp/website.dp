# Values of the collective and project

**Commitment : research and privacy**

•	We are committed to develop awareness, tools, methods, and ultimately be able to push better practices as standard in the dating app industry.

**Transparency**

•	Our purposes are clearly communicated, as such as our activities. We are not here to trick anyone, we are here to learn and bring transparency through knowledge.

**Independence**

•	We are a group of citizens and researchers, with no links with the dating app industry, neither actors in data processing.

**Trust and integrity**

•	We would like to see a restored trust in technologies, through good practices and self-regulation amongst the operators of the different dating app. This starts with us, each of us commits to be trust-worthy, so that the collective can be trusted, and using secured tools.
