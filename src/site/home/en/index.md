  - title: Dating data is sensitive
    description: We would like to see a restored trust in technologies, through good
      practices and self-regulation amongst the operators of the different
      dating app. This starts with us, each of us commits to be trust-worthy, so
      that the collective can be trusted, and using secured tools.

    description: "Dating Privacy is you and me: dating app users and people keen to
      understand privacy in relationships formed online. The collective is
      worried about the way our intimate life is being coded and exposed online.
      We aim to retake control of personal data on dating apps, understand the
      privacy problems they create, and work to improve data literacy."

  - title: We work to understand what's being done
    description: >-
      We want to understand many privacy risks that we, as dating app users, are
      confronted with when looking for a date online: unwanted ads,
      discrimination resulting from data, incorrect profiling and predictions,
      and the possibility of phishing and identity theft by rogue users.


      Our ultimate goal is to bring together users and privacy enthusiasts to push for a paradigm shift.

    description: >-
      We are looking to collaborate with journalists, academics, researchers,
      activists and NGOs in data protection and other related themes.


      We push ideas for better user and company practices to control personal data and date safely online. We are particularly interested in raising awareness, as well as building methodological protocols and privacy tools for data protection and literacy.

  - title: Analysis of your Tinder data
    description: >-
      Thanks to hestialabs's team of developers, we're now able to analysis our
      Tinder data.


      <https://experiences.hestialabs.org/tinder>


      If you don't have  the private data that Tinder collected on you yet,  go to <https://account.gotinder.com/data> . Once you receive it, you'll be able to analyze and see:


      * the number of likes and dislikes that you made over time.

      * the number of times that you opened the app (per day or per month).


      and compare the number of likes, passes, messages sent and messages received and different pairs of values in a donut chart.


      At the end, you can the possible correlation between the number of likes/passes and the number of times you open the app.
