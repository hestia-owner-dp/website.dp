paragraph1_title: We define a new relationship to dating data
community_title: We are a collective of users
community_description: "Dating Privacy is you and me: dating app users and
  people keen to understand privacy in relationships formed online. The
  collective is worried about the way our intimate life is being coded and
  exposed online. We aim to retake control of personal data on dating apps,
  understand the privacy problems they create, and work to improve data
  literacy."

ethics_title: Dating data is sensitive
ethics_description: We would like to see a restored trust in technologies,
  through good practices and self-regulation amongst the operators of the
  different dating app. This starts with us, each of us commits to be
  trust-worthy, so that the collective can be trusted, and using secured tools.

mission_title: We work to understand what's being done
mission_description: >-
  We want to understand many privacy risks that we, as dating app users, are
  confronted with when looking for a date online: unwanted ads, discrimination
  resulting from data, incorrect profiling and predictions, and the possibility
  of phishing and identity theft by rogue users.


  Our ultimate goal is to bring together users and privacy enthusiasts to push for a paradigm shift.

  We are looking to collaborate with journalists, academics, researchers,
  activists and NGOs in data protection and other related themes.


  We push ideas for better user and company practices to control personal data and date safely online. We are particularly interested in raising awareness, as well as building methodological protocols and privacy tools for data protection and literacy.
