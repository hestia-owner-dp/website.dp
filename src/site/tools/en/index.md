# Tinder

Thanks to hestialabs's team of developers, we're now able to analysis our
Tinder data.

<https://experiences.hestialabs.org/tinder>

*If you don't have  the private data that Tinder collected on you yet,  go to <https://account.gotinder.com/data> . Once you receive it, you'll be able to analyze and see:*

* *the number of likes and dislikes that you made over time.*
* *the number of times that you opened the app (per day or per month).*

*and compare the number of likes, passes, messages sent and messages received and different pairs of values in a donut chart.*

*At the end, you can the possible correlation between the number of likes/passes and the number of times you open the app.*
