Grindr has been fined NOK 65 million (â‚¬6.3 million) by the Norwegian Data Protection Authority for illegal data sharing, including the disclosure of personal information to third parties for behavioral marketing without a legal basis, such as users' geo-location data and the fact that they use the dating app to give information about their sexual preferences.
