Dating apps such as Grindr, Scruff, Tinder, OkCupid know a lot about their users: intimate information they might not want to share with their boss, colleagues or family but which is nevertheless shared in their back. A recent church scandal dramatically illustrates how people you never knew existed can use your dating app data and for what purpose. 

### People you never knew existed can use your dating app data

On July 20 2021, Ed Condon and JD Flynn from The Pillar (an American conservative news website focusing on the Roman Catholic Church) [published an article](https://www.pillarcatholic.com/p/pillar-investigates-usccb-gen-sec) stating that “Jeffrey Burrill\[,] the highest-ranking American cleric” was making use of the gay app Grindr:

*“An analysis of app data signals correlated to Burrill’s mobile device shows the priest also visited gay bars and private residences while using a location-based hookup app in numerous cities from 2018 to 2020, even while traveling on assignment for the U.S. bishops’ conference. According to commercially available records of app signal data obtained by The Pillar, a mobile device correlated to Burrill emitted app data signals from the location-based hookup app Grindr on a near-daily basis during parts of 2018, 2019, and 2020 — at both his USCCB office and his USCCB-owned residence, as well as during [USCCB](https://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/get-involved/meetings-and-events) \[The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops'] meetings and events in other cities.”* 

### How could the journalists assert this?

The answer does not only concern high-positioned clerics. It concerns all dating app users and even users of other social networks, like Facebook or Linkedin, collecting geolocation. Indeed, online platforms in general are actors in  the so-called data economy, and depend on it for their revenues. 

Simply put, the data economy is about (i) collecting, (ii) analysing (iii) selling, (iv) reusing data for purposes other than those for which you provided your data in a dating app (e.g., finding a date, chatting). You have probably already given consent to apps for reusing your personal data: those long texts in the terms of use tell you in broad outline that your data is shared with third-party data brokers and for advertisement.

Sometimes, unfortunately, you are not informed by dating apps about which type of data is being shared, nor with whom, see: [Grindr to be fined almost € 10 Mio over GDPR complaint. The Gay Dating App was illegally sharing sensitive data of millions of users.](https://noyb.eu/en/gay-dating-app-grindr-be-fined-almost-eu-10-mio) (January 2020)

### Easy access to personal data

In the data economy, everyone (potentially) can access your position by [buying](https://datarade.ai/data-categories/location-data) a package of location data to a [data broker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_broker). There are also dedicated [websites](https://www.usdate.org/product-category/european) selling dating profiles: for 133 $ you can obtain 443,000 profiles (apparently real profiles). See more about it here: [CPDP 2019: Uncovering the hidden data ecosystem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=KIipe3MOq_A).

The motivation of the buyer for acquiring the data is of little importance. Flynn and Condon are part of this data economy as investigative journalists. They actually claim it is a new common practice in journalism, citing articles recently published by the New York Times.

*“This was the nightmare scenario that we were talking about to some degree. . . . To see it happen is just confirmation of just how dangerous this type of information is, said [Charlie Warzel](https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/catholic-priest-grindr-pillar/2021/07/24/b2772f02-ecb6-11eb-8950-d73b3e93ff7f_story.html). Despite the fact that I don’t think there are any ethical similarities with what we did and this, it obviously makes me feel terrible that our work was used as a justification in this.”*

Flynn and Condon bought a [dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set) of millions of people that use mobile phones where they identified Jeffrey Burrill. In the dataset, it’s not possible to directly find the identity of a person using a first and last name, e-mail or telephone number. But crossing the numerous information available in the dataset (and elsewhere) allowed these two journalists to identify Burrill. The information that can be found in the dataset are: [Mobile Advertising ID (MAID)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising_ID): known as GAID (Google Advertiser Identification) and Apple’s, called IDFA (Identifier For Advertisers), timestamp, and detailed [geolocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopositioning). 

Using geolocation data of buildings owned by the USCCB, the journalists were able to capture the MAIDs emitting signals from those particular places. A particular MAID was emitting on a near-daily basis, which makes it easy to target by its frequency. One of our hypothesis is that the journalists searched devices that regularly emit signals from those specific places, and other places where they could find the same MAID such as gay bars, family residence and Rome. By knowing the place (Rome) and the timestamp, then journalists could search when people from the USCCB were traveling to the Vatican at specific dates. In October 2018, Jeffrey Burrill and 3 others met the pope, see <https://www.ncronline.org/file/20181010t0643-2268-cns-abuse-dinardo-mccarrick-1jpg>.

The same identification and data correlation has been done in another The Pillar's article targeting the Newark archdiocese: over 10 locations (out of 212) were found in a dataset and linked to the archdiocese, see [Newark archdiocese to investigate app use allegations](https://www.pillarcatholic.com/p/newark-archdiocese-to-investigate).

Here is the tricky part: the journalists correlated the data bought with external sources and other data they had about the U.S Catholic conference. This way they were able to identify Jeffrey Burrill. The data analysis backs up the journalists’ statements of Burril’s [“moral failures”](https://www.pillarcatholic.com/p/the-pillar-podcast-ep-28-lets-talk) in the Church.

Interestingly, the data obtained by the journalists goes until January 2020. As of April 2020, Grindr no longer shares age, gender, or location of users with ad partners according to their privacy policy. 

### How far the data economy goes

The journalists’ article and exchanges with the U.S Catholic conference provoked several controversies, focusing in particular, on their ethical and legal justifications for data acquisition and use. Today it’s unknown who, or which company, sold this dataset. The journalists [argue](https://www.pillarcatholic.com/p/the-pillar-podcast-ep-28-lets-talk) these are well-known companies, operating in a widely-understood business quiproquo of trading data for free products. The issue remains how far the data economy goes with such direct, and easy, commercialization of personal data.

Here is our concern about creating a profile, making connections and exchanging messages in a dating application: We give out so much powerful information that can be used against us. For instance, geolocation which enables a dating app to know exactly where we are at any given time.

Grindr collects* the following geolocation data: 

“location_ping_time" : 2021-05-09 18:19:34 UTC; "latitude": 46.523258209228516 "longitude": 6.6323723793029785

happn collects* the following geolocation data: 

**User position:**

Geolocation helps dating apps suggesting you potential dates nearby. But do you know that the data can even be sold to the US military?  See: [How the U.S. Military Buys Location Data from dating apps like Mingle](https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqm5x/us-military-location-data-xmode-locate-x)

### Google or a friend with technical skills will know it’s you

It doesn’t matter if you use your real name or a hot pseudonym on dating apps: journalists, Google, or a friend with technical skills will know it’s you and we still don’t know how far a person can analyse what you do with this data:

* Did you only stay a few minutes on a date? 
* Did you spend the night over your date’s place?

A user of Grindr and Tinder that reached our collective Dating Privacy stated that the apps are tracking him despite the fact he deactivates the app. This is problematic to him as when he visits his family in his home-town he doesn’t want to be seen by people there. When he came back to his place, he gets profile suggestions of users living in his home-town although he specified a very small area around his home (and therefore away from his hometown) in his apps’ preferences.
